# Rust Community Talks

Use this repository to propose or request talks for the various meetups,
conferences, and online webcasts from the Rust Community.

[Propose or request a talk](https://github.com/rust-community/talks/issues); no
need to worry about making mistakes or giving/requesting a talk that's already
been done!

See below for some ideas.

## Proposing a talk

Got an idea for a talk? Raise an issue with the details and label it with
`proposal`, and we'll work with you from there.

## Requesting a talk

Would you like to see a talk on a particular topic? Something you'd like to
understand better, or an interesting area?

Raise an issue with the details and label it with `request`, and we'll see if we
can organise someone to give that talk :)

## What can you talk about?

First up, there's no need to be an expert of any kind, so don't feel like you
have to be in order to talk.

Secondly, you can talk about anything Rust related! Aside from looking at what
other people have requested, here are some ideas:

* Rust for {Java,C++,C,Python,Ruby,Javascript,Scala,Haskell,C#,F#,whatever}
  developers
* Typical Rust gotchas or Rust for beginner programmers
* Understanding trickier bits of Rust the language (borrow checker, marker
  traits, trait objects, unsafety)
* What's new or coming up in the latest version of Rust (similar to
  http://this-week-in-rust.org/ )
* How to contribute to Rust community
* Demonstrate your/someone else's rust library X to solve problem Y
* Anything Cargo (tips, tricks, integration with other builds)
* The history of Rust (e.g. scrapped features, motivations, pivotal RFCs)
* Rust FFI/how to integrate with common C libraries
* Rust usage in a popular project (e.g. Servo, Piston, etc), or a project of
  your own (no matter how trivial!)
* Rust for gamedev/real-time/embedded systems
* How Rust and LLVM work together or how other bits of the Rust compiler work
* Embedding other languages in Rust, or embedding Rust in other languages
* Testing, benchmarking, profiling, debugging, REPL, IDE, editor
  experiences/tips/tricks/tools
* War stories solving bugs, compilation errors, or production experiences
* Anything else Rust-related ;-)
